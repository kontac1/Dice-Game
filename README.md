#Dice-Game (Programming challenge)
This program simulates a dice game between two players; the game uses a loaded dice to favor first player and normal dice for the second player.
Therefore 30% of the time the first player (loaded dice) will roil a 6 and the other 70% the dice roll will be uniform random value between 1 and 6. 
The program allow user to play the game of ten roll as many times as they want and keep track of the number of time players win. 

#lesson learned and challenges:
programming this game was challenging using one dice. Therefore, I created two dice objects. The first dice object is loaded to favor the computer during the game and the second dice is just a normal roll use by the second player.

Programing this game allow me to better understand the implementation of random number generator in java. Also, how to properly documented a java file.
